# fossget

FossGet provides a simple command line utility for cloning FossRec repositories
and checking out the repository to start development -- or, at least, it will,
once there's enough code for it to be useful.

## Dependencies

* Fossil SCM
* a Fossil repository to mirror from FossRec
* a place to put a repository file
* a place to put a repository checkout directory

## Bug Reports And Feature Requests

In order from most preferred to least preferred:

* Add a ticket in the Fossil repository.
* Add a ticket in the GitHub repository (then I'll copy it to Fossil).

## Roadmap

* Write code.
* Incorporate this functionality into FossRec, a more comprehensive tool.
